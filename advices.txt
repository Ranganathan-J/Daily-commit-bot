Always write meaningful commit messages that explain the 'why', not just the 'what'.
Use git branch for feature development: git checkout -b feature/new-feature
Remember to pull before you push: git pull origin main && git push origin branch-name
Write unit tests before implementing your features (TDD approach).
Use git stash to temporarily save changes: git stash push -m "work in progress"
Document your code - your future self will thank you.
Use git log --oneline to see a clean commit history.
Never commit directly to main/master branch in team projects.
Use meaningful variable names - code should read like English.
Create small, focused functions that do one thing well.
Use git rebase -i HEAD~n to clean up your commit history before merging.
Always handle errors gracefully in your applications.
Use git blame to understand code history: git blame filename.ext
Follow the DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself.
Use git cherry-pick to apply specific commits to other branches.
Write code comments that explain complex business logic.
Use git diff to review changes before committing: git diff --staged
Refactor regularly to keep your codebase clean and maintainable.
Use git tag to mark important releases: git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
Learn keyboard shortcuts for your IDE to boost productivity.
Use git reset --soft HEAD~1 to undo the last commit but keep changes staged.
Practice code reviews - they improve code quality and knowledge sharing.
Use git bisect to find the commit that introduced a bug.
Keep your dependencies up to date but test thoroughly after updates.
Use git config --global alias.st status to create useful shortcuts.
